Motivation:

This JS project helped me to understand the complexities in even simple conditional logic statements and for/while loops. 

Being forced to pull from long strngs of characters led to blowing the whole thing up after a few hours and starting over with arrays containing (1) string each, which are chosen at random and added to what we set up as an empty array - to be filled with those strings based on the user's character selections. 

This structure allows the for/while loop to work with only the characters specified by the user, without creating endless strings each containing single characters within one array.
